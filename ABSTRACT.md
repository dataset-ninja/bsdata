Using machine learning (ML) techniques in general and deep learning techniques in specific needs a certain amount of data often not available in large quantities in technical domains. The manual inspection of machine tool components and the manual end-of-line check of products are labor-intensive tasks in industrial applications that companies often want to automate. To automate classification processes and develop reliable and robust machine learning-based classification and wear prognostics models, one needs real-world datasets to train and test the models.

 One important subfield for classification in an industrial context is the inspection of surfaces, be it on [rails](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7727522/), on [concrete](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034615000208), on [wood](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8812894/), or [metallic surfaces of products](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8709818/) or [machine tool components](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000129520). In all these cases, the goal is to detect anomalies on an otherwise intact surface to evaluate the condition of a certain part. Especially metallic surfaces that are found on most machine tool components like **ball screw drives (BSD)**, roller bearings, or linear rail guides are important machine tool components for industrial applications. Robust models for the detection of failures on a wide range of metallic surfaces have the potential to reduce high costs because unforeseen machine breakdowns are prevented and costs for the tedious manual inspection of machine tool components are saved.
