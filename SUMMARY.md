**BSData: Dataset for Instance Segmentation and Industrial Wear Forecasting** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the surface defect detection domain. 

The dataset consists of 394 images with 485 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pitting*). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (324 images) and *test* (70 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 occurring BSD types: ***type_2*** (325 images) and ***type_1*** (69 images). ; or into the 27 wear developments. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.
